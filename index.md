## Mission

The Computational Social Science Group at KAIST is a growing community of scholars dedicated to advancing the study of social phenomena through diverse methodological approachesâ€”including computational, quantitative, experimental, and qualitative research. Our mission is to build a vibrant network that connects researchers within KAIST and across institutions, fostering collaboration and dialogue in the broader social science community. Through regular events such as our Brown Bag series and Special Seminars with guest speakers, we aim to create an inclusive space for scholarly exchange, mentorship, and the development of cutting-edge interdisciplinary research.

## Brown Bag

The Computational Social Science (CSS) Brown Bag is an informal seminar series for students and researchers at KAIST and beyond who are interested in CSS. We host bi-monthly sessions featuring two student presentations. The brown bag aims to foster an inclusive and supportive community for scholarly exchange and collaboration in CSS research.
